# Voluntary Spirit Guidelines

<span style='background-color:#ffff8b;'>**OPEN NEUTRAL  SYNERGY SPACES**</span>

## Open Mind
1. We are open to new ideas and feedback with an open mind.
 2. Our decisions are as per individual discretion with explicit and clear communication. Please do not assume or take specifics for granted.
 3. It is best to ask politely and clearly.

## Neutrality of Opinion
 1. We refrain from any attempt to represent, endorse, attract or indirectly impose or popularize any particular set of beliefs or opinions, political philosophy, guru, organization, cult, sect or any specific way of life. 
 
## Synergy
 1. Once open minded, neutral, calm people experience peace of mind together, then synergy happens leading to unimaginable partnerships, projects and value unlocking for individual and collective welfare.

## Space
1. Here space and silence mean purity of action and speech or communication.
 2.  Silence also means, briefly giving details, in all humility, about your own direct experience (not of others!) and resultant specific practice or world view.
 3. Your originality is appreciated, merely voicing opinions of others doesn't add lasting value.
 4. Space means not trying to prevail over others directly or indirectly, physically or intellectually. Best is to have patience while people and things evolve.
 
## Space for Freedom
1. We respect personal freedom and space of others as much as we care for our own.
 2. We must behave with others as we seek for ourselves.

## Direct Experience Matters
1. We would want to learn strictly by our own personal direct experiences. 
2. We want to learn practically from our own mistakes.

## Set Own Example
1. If in your heart you sincerely desire to help others or make the world better, then please set your own example, be the change you want to see in others. People will be automatically attracted by your positive vibes and behavior. Our behavior is our introduction. Actions speak louder than words.
 2. In the common interest of all concerned, we expect clear communication while you introduce yourself in the beginning in detail, regarding your inner motivation purely for individual self purification by your own individual practice in silence.

## Discuss Your Agenda
1. People with aim other than self purification need to discuss their agenda with the organising volunteers of this website before joining for any activity supported by us.
 2. If you have any intention of spreading any particular message or awareness or network marketing etc., you should better mention in detail in writing before joining the group to avoid any confusion or unpleasant surprises.

## Altruistic Voluntary Spirit
 1. Value comes from time and energy of volunteers that has gone into research, planning, communication, logistics and direct  participation online and on ground.
 2. Altruistic volunteers work without any motive of marketing or material rewards. Our entire effort is thus in purely altruistic Upanishadic spirit and self purification.
 3. Please respect this spirit and do not take anything for granted as in big organized events.

## No Sponsors/Commerce
1. We do not have any commercial agenda, we are not sponsored by any commercial interests. 
2. We do not seek any commercial or organizational sponsorship. 

## Horizontal - Small - Informal
 1. We want to remain a small horizontal informal self organising group of friends only.
 2.  We do not want any intellectual or otherwise leadership support from any one.
